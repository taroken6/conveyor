Schema Overview
---------------

*All schema information is determined by the back end unless otherwise noted

The schema utilized by the framework will be different than the existing schema and will look like::

  {
    <modelName>: {
      tabs: {} #See tab documentation, determined by Front end
      hasIndex: boolean #Whether the model should be included in an index page
      deletable: boolean or function #Whether the given field should be deletable
      creatable: boolean or function #Whether the given field should be creatable
      singleton: boolean #Whether this model is singleton (display one instance only)
      createFieldOrder: #List or a function that returns a list of the order that the create fields display
      indexFieldOrder: #List or a function that returns a list of the order that the index fields display
      detailFieldOrder: #List or a function that returns a list of the order that the detail fields display
      queryName: #Name of gql query that will return a single instance of the model
      queryAllName: #Name of gqlquery that will return all instances of the model
      queryRequired: #List of fields that must be present on the query
      modelName: #Name of model
      displayName: "" #Singular display name of model or function that calculates displayName, used on detail page
      displayNamePlural: "" #Plural display name of Model or function that calculates displayNamePlural, used on index page
      tableLinkField: "" #name of the field/column in a table that links to the detail page, a value of null means no link to the model should be displayed on a table
      displayField: "" #name of field that holds the data used to represent the instance when it is being displayed or referenced, defaults to "name" if left undefined, can also be a function that determines the value for any instance of the model
      fieldOrder: "" #List of ALL fields on a model in the order that they should be displayed on its own Detail and Index pages, also serves as a fall back if a different model is displaying this model without having specified the order in which the fields should be displayed.
      filterable: bool or func #Whether the given table should be filterable (can be set on field lvl as well)
      sortable: bool or func #Whether the given table should be sortable (can be set on field lvl as well)
